I conducted precise testing and debugging so I that I would be able to display 3 different charts containing different data. My original idea was to display the data for rain in Canberra in each individual year but I hadn't spent too much time working on that when I should've, so I simplified that idea and made two charts that would start from the earliest time and the last time the data was recorded, so I would still complete my intention of being able to compare two pieces of data from different years.
